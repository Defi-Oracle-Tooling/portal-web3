## 5. Developer Guide

### Middleware Development
- Create a middleware application to bridge the IBM 800 and modern systems.
- Use JSON or XML for data transformation.

#### Example: Legacy System to REST API Integration
- **Scenario:** A bank needs to expose the IBM 800 terminal’s transaction processing functionality to a web-based interface.
- **Solution:** Develop middleware that:
  - Accepts REST API calls from the web interface.
  - Converts these API calls into commands recognized by the IBM 800 terminal.
  - Processes the terminal’s response and formats it into JSON for the web application.
- **Outcome:** The bank successfully integrates the legacy system with a modern application, improving user experience without replacing the IBM 800.

#### Case Study: Financial Report Automation
- **Client:** A financial institution requiring automated generation of custom reports.
- **Integration:** Middleware was developed to query the IBM 800 terminal’s database, aggregate data, and format it into detailed PDF reports.
- **Result:** The client reduced manual effort by 70% and enhanced reporting accuracy.
